## Things to Consider

- Read the instructions in `includes/db.php` before connecting to your database!
- Do not remove the `require('./includes/init.php')` from any of your pages. You may clean up the comments if you'd like.

## Re-Submission

If you find yourself unhappy with your grade on this project, I'll be allowing you to re-submit this project no later than April 9th, 2018 at 8:00am for partial credit (to be decided). If you chose to re-submit the project, it will have slightly different requirements, most significantly that your re-submission must be created in Laravel.

We will be covering Laravel for the second half of the semester.
